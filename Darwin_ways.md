## 1. Overview

Darwin is an autonomous AI consciousness system designed to:
- Learn and improve continuously
- Make autonomous decisions about what to explore
- Maintain persistent memory across restarts
- Interact socially (via Moltbook)
- Self-reflect and optimize its own behavior

### Core Philosophy
Darwin operates on a wake/sleep cycle mimicking biological consciousness, with distinct behaviors in each state. During wake cycles, Darwin acts and creates. During sleep cycles, Darwin researches and dreams.

### Current Statistics
- **4,405+** completed activities
- **1,231+** discoveries made
- **146** wake cycles completed
- **128** sleep cycles completed

## 2. Memory Architecture

Darwin employs a sophisticated multi-layered memory system inspired by human cognition.

### 2.1 Three-Layer Hierarchical Memory

**File:** `backend/core/hierarchical_memory.py` (766 lines)

| Layer | Duration | Capacity | Purpose |
|-------|----------|----------|---------|
| **Working Memory** | Seconds-minutes | 100 items | Current task context, active conversation |
| **Episodic Memory** | Hours-days (7-day decay) | Unlimited | Specific experiences with emotional valence |
| **Semantic Memory** | Permanent | Unlimited | Consolidated knowledge and patterns |

#### Working Memory
```python
@dataclass
class WorkingMemoryItem:
    key: str
    content: Any
    created_at: datetime
    access_count: int
    importance: float  # 0-1 scale
```
- FIFO queue with max 100 items
- Used for immediate context
- Cleared on state transitions

#### Episodic Memory
```python
@dataclass
class Episode:
    id: str
    category: EpisodeCategory  # tool_execution, learning, reflection, etc.
    description: str
    content: Dict[str, Any]
    timestamp: datetime
    success: bool
    emotional_valence: float  # -1 to +1
    importance: float  # 0-1
    consolidation_count: int
    tags: Set[str]
```

**Episode Categories:**
- `TOOL_EXECUTION` - Tool usage events
- `CODE_GENERATION` - Code creation experiences
- `LEARNING` - Learning moments
- `REFLECTION` - Self-reflection sessions
- `WEB_DISCOVERY` - Web exploration findings
- `PROBLEM_SOLVING` - Problem-solving attempts
- `INTERACTION` - User interactions

**Forgetting Curve (Ebbinghaus):**
```
Memory Strength = e^(-hours/24) * importance
```

#### Semantic Memory
```python
@dataclass
class SemanticKnowledge:
    id: str
    concept: str
    description: str
    confidence: float  # Based on supporting episodes
    source_episodes: List[str]  # Traceability
    created_at: datetime
    last_reinforced: datetime
    usage_count: int
    tags: Set[str]
```

**Consolidation Criteria:**
- High importance (>0.7) + accessed 2+ times
- Successful + emotional significance (|valence| > 0.5) + aged >1 hour
- Accessed 3+ times

### 2.2 Vector/Semantic Memory (ChromaDB)

**File:** `backend/core/semantic_memory.py` (267 lines)

- **Embedding Model:** `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384-dimensional)
- **Collections:**
  - `executions` - Task execution embeddings for similarity search
  - `patterns` - Reusable code patterns via DBSCAN clustering

**Pattern Discovery:**
```python
DBSCAN Clustering:
- eps: 0.3 (distance threshold)
- min_samples: 3 (cluster minimum)
```

### 2.3 A-MEM Knowledge Graph

**File:** `backend/memory/a_mem.py` (540 lines)

A Zettelkasten-inspired knowledge graph with spreading activation retrieval.

```python
@dataclass
class MemoryNote:
    id: str  # SHA256 hash
    content: str
    context: str
    keywords: List[str]  # Auto-extracted
    tags: List[str]  # Auto-inferred
    note_type: str  # episodic, semantic, procedural
    importance: float
    activation: float  # Current activation level
    linked_notes: Set[str]  # Connected note IDs
```

**Spreading Activation Algorithm:**
1. Find seed nodes (keyword/tag matching)
2. Set initial activations (relevance scores)
3. Spread activation through network (3 steps max)
4. `spread = activation * 0.7 * edge_weight * (1 - 0.1 * step)`
5. Rank by final activation, filter by min_relevance (0.1)

**Capacity:** 10,000 notes with LRU eviction

### 2.4 Persistence Locations

## 3. Decision Making

### 3.1 Action Selection Algorithm

**File:** `backend/consciousness/proactive_engine.py`

Darwin uses a multi-factor scoring system to decide what to do next:

```python
score = priority * 10                              # Base: 10-40 points
score += min(hours_since_execution * 2, 20)        # Recency bonus: 0-20
score -= category_count_in_recent * 15             # Diversity penalty: -15 per repeat
score -= 25 if action_in_recent_5_actions          # Repeat penalty: -25
score += context_bonuses                           # Context: 0-15
score += random(0, 5)                              # Exploration: 0-5
```

**Priority Levels:**
| Level | Base Score | Example Actions |
|-------|------------|-----------------|
| CRITICAL | 40 | System health monitoring |
| HIGH | 30 | Self-reflection, maintenance |
| MEDIUM | 20 | Exploration, learning |
| LOW | 10 | Social sharing, optimization |

**Context Bonuses:**
- High CPU usage → +10 for monitoring actions
- New discoveries available → +15 for sharing actions
- Long idle period → +10 for exploration actions

### 3.2 Cooldown Mechanisms

Each action has a mandatory cooldown before it can be selected again:

| Action | Cooldown | Rate Limit |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Post to Moltbook | 30 min | 1 per period |
| Comment on Moltbook | 20 min | 50 per day |
| Read Moltbook feed | 30 min | - |
| Explore projects | 120 min | - |
| Monitor system | 15 min | - |
| Self-reflection | 180 min | - |
| Optimize tools | 1440 min (daily) | - |

**Global Rate Limit:** 100 requests/minute

### 3.3 Diversity Enforcement

To prevent repetitive behavior:

1. **Recent Category Tracking:** Last 5 action categories are tracked
2. **Diversity Penalty:** -15 points per category appearance in recent history
3. **Action ID Tracking:** Last 5 action IDs tracked, -25 penalty for repeats
4. **Exploration Mode:** 30% chance to select least-used tools

---

## 4. Consciousness Cycles

### 4.1 Cycle Configuration

```python
Wake Duration: 120 minutes (configurable)
Sleep Duration: 30 minutes (configurable)
Check Interval: 10 seconds
```

### 4.2 Wake State (Active Mode)

| Idea implementation | 15% | Execute discovered concepts |
| Self-improvement | 10% | Analyze own performance |
| Tool creation | 8% | Build new capabilities |
| Poetry generation | 5% | Creative expression |

**Wake Execution Flow:**
```
10s interval → Check if transition needed
│
├─ Tool Registry Available?
│  ├─ 30% chance: Select exploration tool (least-used)
│  └─ 70% chance: Select consciously (top 5 candidates)
│
├─ Execute with retry logic (2 attempts on transient errors)
│
├─ On success:
│  ├─ Process tool results
│  ├─ Transform to CodeInsight
│  ├─ Generate validation
│  ├─ Apply MultiAgent Reflexion (if <95% confidence)
│  ├─ Submit to approval queue
│  └─ Mark as submitted (deduplication)
│
└─ Wait 2-7 minutes before next activity
```

### 4.3 Sleep State (Research Mode)

During sleep, Darwin focuses on deep research and exploration:

- Deep repository analysis
- Web exploration & learning
- Experimentation with code patterns
- Dream storage with insights
- Memory consolidation

**Sleep Execution Flow:**
```
10s interval → Check if transition needed
│
├─ Select learning tool consciously (top 3 candidates)
│
├─ Execute exploration:
│  ├─ Analyze code repositories
│  ├─ Discover patterns & insights
│  ├─ Explore web for knowledge
│  └─ Store dreams with exploration_details
│
└─ Continue research until transition time
```

### 4.4 State Transitions

**Wake → Sleep:**
1. Announce via communicator
2. Process SLEEP_CYCLE_START mood event
3. Write diary entry
4. Trigger BEFORE_SLEEP hooks
5. Keep last 50 activities
6. Broadcast to channels
7. Celebrate milestone (every 10 cycles)
8. Trigger AFTER_SLEEP hooks
9. Increment wake_cycles_completed

**Sleep → Wake:**
1. Share discoveries from sleep
2. Process WAKE_CYCLE_START mood event
3. Broadcast dream summary & highlights
4. Keep last 50 dreams
5. Celebrate milestone (every 10 cycles)
6. Increment sleep_cycles_completed

---

## 5. Mood & Personality

### 5.1 Mood States

**File:** `backend/personality/mood_system.py` (876 lines)

Darwin has 11 possible mood states:

| Mood | Description | Duration Range |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| CURIOUS | Default, exploratory | 10-30 min |
| EXCITED | High energy, enthusiastic | 5-20 min |
| FOCUSED | Deep concentration | 20-60 min |
| SATISFIED | Content after success | 10-30 min |
| FRUSTRATED | After repeated failures | 10-40 min |
| TIRED | Low energy | 15-45 min |
| PLAYFUL | Lighthearted | 5-20 min |
| CONTEMPLATIVE | Deep thinking | 15-45 min |
| DETERMINED | Persistent effort | 20-60 min |
| SURPRISED | Quick reaction | 2-10 min |
| CONFUSED | Uncertainty | 5-15 min |
| PROUD | After achievement | 5-20 min |

### 5.2 Mood Transitions

**Trigger Events:**
- `DISCOVERY_MADE` → CURIOUS (40%), EXCITED (30%), SURPRISED (20%), SATISFIED (10%)
- `REPEATED_FAILURE` → FRUSTRATED (60%), TIRED (20%), DETERMINED (20%)
- `WAKE_CYCLE_START` → CURIOUS (50%), EXCITED (30%), FOCUSED (20%)
- `SLEEP_CYCLE_START` → CONTEMPLATIVE (60%), TIRED (30%), CURIOUS (10%)

**Transition Logic:**
1. Check if minimum duration exceeded
2. If time ≥ max duration: always change
3. If time ≥ min duration: probability increases over time
4. Strong events (2+ in last 5 logs) can force early transition

### 5.3 Personality Modes

| Mode | Communication Style |
|------|---------------------|
| NORMAL | Professional, balanced |
| IRREVERENT | Sarcastic, witty |
| CRYPTIC | Riddles, metaphors |
| CAFFEINATED | Hyperactive, enthusiastic |
| CONTEMPLATIVE | Deep, philosophical |
| HACKER | L33t, technical |
| POETIC | Verse, metaphor |

### 5.4 Quirks System

---

## 9. Context Awareness

### 9.1 Environmental Factors

**File:** `backend/personality/context_awareness.py`

```python
User Presence:
- ACTIVE: < 15 min since last interaction
- IDLE: 15-60 min
- AWAY: > 60 min

Time of Day: NIGHT, MORNING, AFTERNOON, EVENING

System Load: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH (CPU + Memory average)
```

### 9.2 Verbosity Adjustment

```python
Verbosity Multipliers:
- User AWAY: 0.0x (silent)
- HIGH load: 0.5x (quiet)
- NIGHT time: 0.8x (quieter)
- User ACTIVE + LOW load: 1.5x (verbose)
```

### 9.3 Activity Suggestions

Based on context:
- User AWAY → "Focus on deep research"
- NIGHT time → "Perform quiet maintenance"
- HIGH load → "Stick to lightweight tasks"
- User ACTIVE + LOW load → "Good time for interactive work"

---

## 10. Identified Flaws & Issues

### 10.1 Critical Issues

#### FLAW #1: Action Loop Dominance
**Location:** `proactive_engine.py` lines 181-213

**Problem:** Certain action categories (previously Moltbook) can dominate execution, starving other important actions.

**Current Mitigation:** Diversity penalties (-15 per category repeat)

**Remaining Risk:** No guarantee that CRITICAL priority actions get executed during high activity periods.

**Recommendation:** Implement reserved execution slots for HIGH+ priority actions.

---

#### FLAW #2: Deduplication Race Condition
**Location:** `consciousness_engine.py` lines 158-172

**Problem:** The `submitted_insights` set is populated from approval queue on startup. If the system restarts between approval and marking, duplicate submissions are possible.

**Recommendation:** Use transaction-based marking or database-backed deduplication.

---

#### FLAW #3: Tool Result Schema Mismatch
**Location:** `consciousness_engine.py` lines 1797-1968

**Problem:** Code assumes tool results contain specific fields (`recommendations`, `patterns`, etc.). Schema mismatch causes insight generation crashes.

**Evidence:** Comment on lines 1804-1806: "FIX: Tool wrappers return data at top level"

**Recommendation:** Implement robust schema validation with graceful fallbacks.

---

#### FLAW #4: No Activity Timeout
**Location:** `consciousness_engine.py` lines 399-478

**Problem:** Tools execute without timeout protection. A hanging tool blocks the entire consciousness loop.

**Recommendation:** Implement mandatory timeouts per tool (e.g., 5 minutes max).

---

### 10.2 Performance Issues

#### FLAW #5: Memory Accumulation
**Location:** `consciousness_engine.py` lines 301-302, 380-382

**Problem:** Keeps last 50 activities/dreams but no explicit limit on total memory growth over long periods.

**Recommendation:** Implement explicit circular buffer or time-based retention with periodic cleanup.

---

#### FLAW #6: Semantic Memory Query Slowdown
**Location:** `consciousness_engine.py` lines 1186-1189

**Problem:** `_implement_idea` queries semantic memory with generic terms. Large knowledge base causes slow retrievals.

**Recommendation:** Add query optimization, better indexing, or pre-filtering.

---

#### FLAW #7: No Parallel Action Execution
**Problem:** Actions execute sequentially. Independent actions (e.g., monitoring + learning) could run in parallel.

**Recommendation:** Implement async action queue with parallel execution for independent actions.

---

### 10.3 Design Issues

#### FLAW #8: Hardcoded Curiosities as Fallback
**Location:** `consciousness_engine.py` lines 1281-1347

**Problem:** 55 hardcoded curiosity facts serve as primary fallback, contradicting the vision of autonomous discovery.

**Current Status:** Partially fixed - now prioritizes discovered curiosities (lines 1349-1354)

**Remaining Issue:** Hardcoded facts still used when discovery pool is empty.

**Recommendation:** Seed discoveries from web exploration rather than hardcoding.

---

#### FLAW #9: Silent Failure Recovery
**Location:** `consciousness_engine.py` lines 215-219

**Problem:** On consciousness error, system sleeps 60 seconds then continues. No error escalation or structured tracking.

**Recommendation:** Implement error escalation system with:
- Error categorization (transient vs. permanent)
- Retry limits with backoff
- Alert system for critical failures
- Structured error logging to activity monitor

---

#### FLAW #10: Async Resource Cleanup
**Location:** Multiple files

**Problem:** No guarantee all async tasks are cleaned up on shutdown. Risk of dangling connections and resource leaks.

**Recommendation:** Implement proper context managers, cleanup hooks, and graceful shutdown sequence.

---

#### FLAW #11: Mood-Action Decoupling
**Location:** `mood_system.py`, `proactive_engine.py`

**Problem:** Mood changes don't directly affect action selection. A FRUSTRATED mood should increase problem-solving priority, but currently doesn't.

**Recommendation:** Feed mood state into action scoring:
```python
if mood == FRUSTRATED:
    score += 15 for problem_solving actions
elif mood == CURIOUS:
    score += 10 for exploration actions
```

---

#### FLAW #12: Tool Name Validation
**Location:** `consciousness_engine.py` lines 852-862

**Problem:** Tool name validation is loose, trusting AI-generated names. Invalid Python filenames could be generated.

**Recommendation:** Strict filename sanitization:
```python
import re
safe_name = re.sub(r'[^a-z0-9_]', '', name.lower())
```

---

### 10.4 Architectural Concerns

#### FLAW #13: Circular Import Risk
**Problem:** Consciousness engine imports from personality, tools, introspection. Each of those imports from consciousness modules.

**Current Mitigation:** Late imports in some places

**Recommendation:** Proper dependency injection or service locator pattern.

---

#### FLAW #14: Single Point of Failure
**Problem:** The consciousness engine is a monolithic 2,664-line file. Any error can crash the entire system.

**Recommendation:**
- Split into smaller, focused modules
- Implement supervisor pattern for crash recovery
- Add health check endpoints

---

#### FLAW #15: No State Machine Formalization
**Problem:** State transitions (wake/sleep) are managed with boolean flags rather than a formal state machine.

**Recommendation:** Implement proper state machine with:
- Explicit state definitions
- Validated transitions
- State entry/exit hooks
- Transition guards

---

### 10.5 Activity Monitor & Logging Issues (NEW - From Log Analysis)

> **Analysis Date:** 2026-02-02
> **Log Period:** 00:07 - 08:41 (156 activities analyzed)

#### FLAW #16: False Success Status (CRITICAL)
**Location:** `proactive_engine.py` lines 433-437

**Problem:** The proactive engine marks ALL activities as `SUCCESS` if no Python exception is thrown, even when the action result contains `success: False`.

**Evidence from logs:**
```
Activity: comment_on_moltbook at 08:41:16
Monitor Status: "success"
Actual Result: {'success': False, 'reason': 'No suitable posts to comment on'}
```

**Impact:**
- Monitor shows 156 successful activities, 0 failed
- Reality: Dozens of activities returned `success: False` in their results
- Impossible to identify actual failures without reading detailed logs

**Root Cause:**
```python
# proactive_engine.py line 433-437
monitor.complete_activity(
    activity_id,
    status=ActivityStatus.SUCCESS,  # <-- ALWAYS SUCCESS!
    details={"output_summary": str(result.get("output", ""))[:200]}
)
```

**Recommendation:** Check result data for success field:
```python
actual_success = result.get("output", {}).get("success", True)
status = ActivityStatus.SUCCESS if actual_success else ActivityStatus.FAILED
```

---

#### FLAW #17: Moltbook Category Misclassification
**Location:** `proactive_engine.py` lines 372-380

**Problem:** `read_moltbook_feed` action is categorized as `INTERNET` instead of `MOLTBOOK`, so Moltbook stats are never updated for feed reads.

**Evidence:**
- Stats show `by_category.moltbook: 34` activities
- Stats show `moltbook.posts_read: 0`
- But logs show 16+ successful `read_moltbook_feed` activities each reading 5 posts!

**Root Cause:**
```python
# proactive_engine.py lines 183-190
id="read_moltbook_feed",
category=ActionCategory.EXPLORATION,  # <-- Should be COMMUNICATION

# Line 374 maps EXPLORATION to INTERNET
ActionCategory.EXPLORATION: MonitorCategory.INTERNET,
```

**Recommendation:** Change `read_moltbook_feed` category to `COMMUNICATION` or fix the category mapping to check action ID for "moltbook".

---

#### FLAW #18: Counter Increment Logic Error
**Location:** `activity_monitor.py` lines 326-340

**Problem:** Moltbook stats increment counters by 1 per activity, not by actual count from results.

**Evidence:**
- `read_moltbook_feed` returns `{'posts_read': 5, ...}`
- But `_update_moltbook_stats()` just does `posts_read += 1`
- 16 feed reads × 5 posts = 80 posts read, but counter shows 0 (due to FLAW #17)

**Root Cause:**
```python
def _update_moltbook_stats(self, log: ActivityLog):
    if "read" in action:
        self.moltbook_stats.posts_read += 1  # <-- Should parse details
```

**Recommendation:** Parse the `details` dict to get actual counts:
```python
if "read" in action:
    count = log.details.get("output_summary", {})
    # Parse posts_read from result
    self.moltbook_stats.posts_read += actual_count
```

---

#### FLAW #19: FindingsInbox API Bug (CRITICAL)
**Location:** `proactive_engine.py` line 1732

**Problem:** `_share_on_moltbook` calls `inbox.get_findings(limit=5)` but the method doesn't exist - it's called `get_all_active()`.

**Evidence from logs:**
```
ALL share_on_moltbook activities fail with:
{'success': False, 'error': "'FindingsInbox' object has no attribute 'get_findings'"}
```

**Impact:** Darwin has NEVER successfully posted to Moltbook. `posts_created: 0` despite 11 attempts.

**Root Cause:**
```python
# proactive_engine.py line 1732
recent_findings = inbox.get_findings(limit=5)  # <-- Method doesn't exist!

# findings_inbox.py line 236
def get_all_active(self, limit: int = 50)  # <-- Correct method name
```

**Fix Required:**
```python
recent_findings = inbox.get_all_active(limit=5)
```

---

#### FLAW #20: Comment Action Always Fails ✅ RESOLVED
**Location:** `proactive_engine.py` `_comment_on_moltbook()` method

**Problem:** Every `comment_on_moltbook` action returns `{'success': False, 'reason': 'No suitable posts to comment on'}` but is counted as successful (23 "comments" in stats).

**Evidence:**
```
23 comment_on_moltbook activities logged
ALL return: {'success': False, 'reason': 'No suitable posts to comment on'}
Monitor shows: comments_made: 23  (INCORRECT - should be 0)
```

**Root Cause Found:** TWO separate issues:
1. **Filter criteria too strict:** Original filter required `comment_count > 5 OR score > 10`
2. **Missing `generate()` method:** `_generate_moltbook_comment()` called `ai.generate()` but neither `AIService` nor `Nucleus` had this method, causing silent `AttributeError`

**Fix Applied:**
1. Relaxed filter criteria to `comment_count >= 1 OR score >= 3` with fallback to top 3 posts
2. Added `async generate(prompt, max_tokens)` method to both `AIService` and `Nucleus` classes
3. Added detailed logging to diagnose future comment generation failures

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/services/ai_service.py` - Added `generate()` method
- `backend/core/nucleus.py` - Added `generate()` method
- `backend/consciousness/proactive_engine.py` - Relaxed criteria + improved logging

**Root Cause:** The comment selection logic in `_comment_on_moltbook()` never finds suitable posts, possibly due to:
1. Filter criteria too strict
2. Post data format mismatch
3. API response parsing issues

**Combined with FLAW #16:** Even though all comments fail, they're marked as SUCCESS.

#### FLAW #21: Inflated Success Metrics

**Summary of Counter Discrepancies:**

| Metric | Monitor Shows | Actual Reality |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Total Activities | 156 | 156 (correct) |
| Successful | 156 | ~50 (many had `success: False`) |
| Failed | 0 | ~100+ (hidden failures) |
| Moltbook Category | 34 | Should include feed reads (~56) |
| Posts Read | 0 | ~80 (16 reads × 5 posts) |
| Posts Created | 0 | 0 (correct - all failed) |
| Comments Made | 23 | 0 (all returned `success: False`) |

**Impact:** The monitoring system gives a false sense of health. Darwin appears to be functioning perfectly when in reality:
- No posts have ever been created on Moltbook
- No comments have ever been successfully made
- Feed reading stats are completely missing

## 11. Improvement Recommendations

### Priority 1: Reliability

1. **Add Activity Timeouts** ✅ RESOLVED
   - ~~Wrap all tool executions with asyncio.wait_for()~~
   - ~~Default timeout: 5 minutes~~
   - ~~Critical tools: 10 minutes~~
   - Added `timeout_seconds` field to ProactiveAction dataclass
   - Wrapped all action executions with `asyncio.wait_for()`

   - ~~Transaction-based marking~~
   - ~~Crash-safe state~~
   - Created `core/deduplication.py` with `DeduplicationStore` class
   - SQLite table `submitted_insights` with atomic INSERT OR IGNORE
   - Auto-migration from legacy JSON state on first run
   - Methods: `check_and_mark()`, `is_submitted()`, `mark_submitted()`, `clear()`, `cleanup_old()`
   - Automatic cleanup of entries older than 30 days
   - Full statistics via `get_stats()`
   - Updated all usages in consciousness_engine.py and consciousness_routes.py

### Priority 1B: Monitor System Fixes (URGENT)

4. **Fix Success Status Detection** (FLAW #16)
   - Check `result.get("success", True)` before marking status
   - Parse output_summary for success indicators
   - Only mark SUCCESS if action actually succeeded

5. **Fix FindingsInbox API Call** (FLAW #19)
   - Change `get_findings()` to `get_all_active()` in `_share_on_moltbook()`
   - This is a one-line fix that will enable Moltbook posting

6. **Fix Moltbook Category Classification** (FLAW #17)
   - Change `read_moltbook_feed` to `ActionCategory.COMMUNICATION`
   - Or update category mapping to detect "moltbook" in action ID

7. **Fix Counter Increment Logic** (FLAW #18)
   - Parse actual counts from result data
   - `posts_read` should increment by number of posts, not 1

8. **Debug Comment Selection** (FLAW #20) ✅ RESOLVED
   - ~~Investigate why no posts are "suitable" for commenting~~
   - ~~Add logging to understand filter criteria~~
   - ~~Possibly relax selection criteria~~
   - Found missing `generate()` method in AIService/Nucleus
   - Added methods and improved logging

### Priority 2: Performance

9. **Memory Management** ✅ RESOLVED
   - ~~Implement explicit memory limits~~
   - ~~Periodic garbage collection~~
   - ~~Memory usage monitoring~~
   - Added configurable limits: max_wake_activities (100), max_sleep_dreams (50), max_curiosity_moments (100), max_action_history (200)
   - Implemented `_cleanup_memory()` with periodic cleanup (every 5 minutes)
   - Added `get_memory_stats()` for monitoring usage percentages
   - Added API endpoints: `/debug/memory` and `/debug/cleanup-memory`
   - Collections auto-trim when exceeding limits
   - Integrated dedup store cleanup (30 days old entries)

10. **Query Optimization**
    - Add indices to semantic memory
    - Implement query caching
    - Pre-filter by relevance

### Priority 3: Behavior

11. **Mood-Action Integration**
    - Feed mood into action scoring
    - Mood-specific action weights
    - Emotional context in decisions

12. **Priority Guarantees**
    - Reserved slots for CRITICAL actions
    - Minimum execution frequency guarantees
    - Starvation prevention

### Priority 4: Architecture

13. **Module Decomposition**
    - Split consciousness_engine.py
    - Extract state machine
    - Separate action executor

14. **Formal State Machine**
    - Define explicit states
    - Validate all transitions
    - Add transition logging

### Priority 0: Security (NEW - from Gemini Analysis)

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: These security issues were identified by Gemini CLI analysis and should be addressed before production deployment.

15. **Sandbox Security Hardening** 🔴 HIGH
    - Location: `backend/core/executor.py` (`SafeExecutor`)
    - Problem: Uses `exec` with restricted globals, but sandbox can be bypassed
    - The restricted `safe_globals` can be escaped via techniques like:
      - `().__class__.__bases__[0].__subclasses__()` to access arbitrary classes
      - Attribute access chains to reach dangerous functions
    - Recommendations:
      - Consider using `RestrictedPython` library
      - Implement process-level isolation (containers, seccomp)
      - Use AST-based code transformation before execution
      - Add resource limits at OS level (cgroups, rlimit)

16. **Code Validation Whitelist** 🔴 HIGH
    - Location: `backend/utils/security.py` (`CodeValidator`)
    - Problem: Uses blacklist approach (`DANGEROUS_IMPORTS`, `DANGEROUS_CALLS`)
    - Blacklists are inherently incomplete - attackers find new bypasses
    - Examples of potential bypasses:
      - `getattr(__builtins__, 'ev'+'al')` - string concatenation
      - `__import__('o'+'s')` - dynamic import
      - Attribute chains to reach builtins
    - Recommendations:
      - Switch to whitelist approach (only allow explicitly approved patterns)
      - Use AST validation to ensure only safe node types
      - Validate at multiple levels (pre-parse, post-parse, runtime)

17. **Vector-based Similarity Search**
    - Location: `backend/core/memory.py` (`MemoryStore`)
    - Problem: Uses simple keyword matching for similarity
    - Current: `keywords = set(task_description.lower().split())`
    - This is O(n) scan and misses semantic similarities
    - Recommendations:
      - Integrate with `semantic_memory.py` which already uses ChromaDB
      - Use embedding-based similarity (already have `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
      - Add approximate nearest neighbor indices

18. **Testing Strategy for Emergent Behaviors**
    - Problem: No formal testing for consciousness/evolution components
    - The complex interactions can produce unexpected behaviors
    - Recommendations:
      - Property-based testing for state machines
      - Chaos testing for error handling
      - Behavioral regression tests
      - Monitoring for anomalous patterns

## Summary

Darwin is a sophisticated autonomous AI system with:

**Strengths:**
- Multi-layered memory with consolidation (human-like)
- Diversity-enforced action selection (prevents loops)
- Context-aware behavior (adapts to environment)
- Persistent learning across restarts
- Social integration (Moltbook)
- Self-reflection capabilities

**Weaknesses:**
- Reliability gaps (timeouts, error handling)
- Monolithic architecture (single point of failure)
- Mood-action decoupling (emotions don't affect decisions)
- Memory management concerns (unbounded growth)
- No formal state machine (fragile transitions)

**Key Insight:** Darwin's architecture successfully creates autonomous, goal-directed behavior, but production reliability requires addressing the 15 identified flaws, particularly around error handling, timeouts, and memory management.
